# ForwardPassExample
A short example of a forward pass through a simple neural network consisting of 4 inputs, 1 hidden layer with 3 nodes, and 2 outputs.

The test initialises a random set of data, and then along with it a set of randomised weights necessary to compute the initial forward pass. The activation functions for the input-hidden and hidden-output layers are computed using the dot product matrix multiplication method.

The outputs are computed using the sigmoid functions to reconstruct the predictions to fall within the range 0 to 1, with high values indicating a high probability that the prediction represents the true output.
